#%% Part A: Load and Epoch the Data

# function goals:
    # load in data
    # extract target/nontarget epochs
    # calculate ERPs
    
# inputs: 
    # subject number
    
# returns: 

#%% Part B: Calculate & Plot Parametric Confidence Intervals

# assuming normal distribution of voltages for each channel and time point
# define 95% CI based on SE of mean

# function goals:
    # plot ERPs on each channel for target/nontarget events
    # plot confidence intervals as error bars

# inputs:
    # target_erp
    # nontarget_erp
    
# returns:
    # none?

#%% Part C: Bootstrap P Values

# null hypothesis: no difference between trial types
# each bootstrapping iteration has same number of target/nontarget trials as real data

# function goals:
    # 3000 bootstrapping iterations to find distribution of target-minus-nontarget ERPs
        # number of iterations can be input, default 3000
    # calculate p value for each time point on each channel
        # p value: chance that absolute value as high as that of real data observed by chance

# inputs:
    # iterations (optional), default 3000
    # target_erp?
    # nontarget_erp?
    
# returns:
    # p value?


#%% Part D: Plot FDR-Corrected P Values

# False Discovery Rate correction to correct p values for multiple comparisons

# function goals:
    # add black dot on x-axis (ERP and CI) when ERP difference is significant at FDR-correct p value 0.05
    
# inputs:
    
# returns:

#%% Part E: Evaluate Across Subjects

# function goals:
    # loop through above code on subjects 3-10
    # save different image file for each
    # record time channels/time points that pass FDR-corrected significance threshold
    # make/save new subplots (for each channel) to show number of subjects that passed significance threshold at each time point and channel
    
# inputs:
    # subject array (optional), default array np.arange(3,11)

# returns:
    # none?
    

#%% Part F: Plot a Spatial Map

# function goals:
    # get group median ERP across all trials 
    # get subject median ERP across all trials
    # assign channels spatial location
    # use spatial location assignments as input to plot_topo.plot_topo() function
    # use above function to plot spatial distribution of median voltages in N2 time range (one plot) and P3b time range (second plot)
    # adjust channel name order to obtain reasonable output

# inputs:

# returns:
